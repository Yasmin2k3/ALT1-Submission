                <p>
                  You are to design, research, and build a functioning website.
                  This website can be on any topic but must capture data from
                  the user, store it in a database and retrieve the data to be
                  displayed in an appropriate format.
                </p>

                <h2>Evaluation of Designs</h2>
                <p>
                  My initial idea was to create a webpage where you could create characters and input game statistics as well as side information about them, and have the website display this using cards. 
                  After brainstorming and doing some project-planning, I decided to de-scope given the time and resources constraints. This allowed me to get over the learning curve that comes with
                  learning a new language and focus on the quality of what I could put in.

                  I'm quite interested in Dungeons and Dragons, and I thought it
                  would be fun to design and code a webpage in which you
                  could create, show, edit and delete custom characters.

                <p>
                  The home page allows you to view all of the characters that
                  you have made, it has a neat navbar at the top that lets you
                  create a new character and also brings you to the ALT report going into further detail of this project.
                  Thanks to Bootstrap (an HTML and CSS framework that
                  simplifies the creation of responsive websites). When you click on the picture of the character, it shows further details that the user has inputted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The &quot;Create New&quot; button on the navbar allows you to make a new character and stores this information into the Firebase database.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The &quot;Edit&quot; button on the card allows you to edit the information and updates the corresponding collection in Firebase.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The &quot;Delete&quot; button on the card allows you to delete the character and also deletes the collection in Firebase.

                <h3>What parts of the project worked out as expected?</h3>
                <p>
                  A lot of the CSS and HTML worked out as expected because I
                  mainly looked up how to do things on Bootstrap, and the code that
                  was given worked. 
                  The usefulness of Bootstrap as a framework was that a lot of the design was precoded and I only needed to invoke the relevant code. 
                  It saved me from having to specify many things like margins, padding etc.
                  The CSS language as a whole was easy to grasp and it did not take me long before I was able to easily style elements on the webpage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Glitch was easy to use and is intuitive when it comes to making files and editing them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thankfully, the code to connect the webpage to Firebase already existed so I just needed to copy that.

                <h3>What were the biggest challenges of the project?</h3>
                <p>
                  The biggest challenge was to connect my project to Firebase.
                  The functions of getting the data, creating data etc. took a
                  while to understand. At the start everything looked Greek to me. It took a few days to get my head around it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Similarly, Javascript, HTML and CSS were all languages that I had no prior experience with. This was a huge jump from Python and I had to use a different method in my approach to coding,
                  as I didn't have the time to comprehensively delve into them. My solution was to use Google as my friend, and look up online certain functions that I was familiar with through Python.
                  For example, I had to look up how to do a <code>for loop</code> in Javascript.

                <h3>What parts of the project did not work out as expected?</h3>
                <p>
                  I tried to give a different hover colour to the navbar but for
                  some reason I couldn't get it to work. I think there is some element in the Bootstrap code that is overriding my customisation but I don't know what. I would be able to solve this
                  but it would take me time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I would prefer the alignment of the pictures in the &quot;Show&quot; screen to be centered, but again I believe that Bootstrap has code that is preventing me from doing this.
                  Once again, I would need to research what customisation I need to make to achieve this.

                <h3>What unexpected questions arose during your project?</h3>
                <p>
                  Glitch has a different way of importing images. It saves it on one folder and you need to upload it there and copy a specific key into the html for the picture to show.
                  I previously thought that a large amount of this string actually stayed the same, so what I used to show the pictures on each card was just changed a little bit of the string, which was easier to do than bringing up all different keys, and this worked!
                  However, when I recently entered a few more pictures, I found they werent working. Taking a closer look I found out that the long string changes based on the day you import it into the folder. I had to reload all the pictures on the same day for my code to work and I found this really annoying
                  to work with.
